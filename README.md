# ML_LandMark-Detection
A brief, to-the-point description is great for a quick overview.  Deep learning project for landmark recognition using a fine-tuned VGG19 model.

This is a landmark recognition project I coded up. The core of it is a VGG19 model that I've fine-tuned. The whole thing is built around a data pipeline that pulls images from a list of URLs, which was a good challenge to get right. It trains the model and then tests it out, so you can see the predictions on a validation set. It's a pretty clean example of how to use transfer learning for a custom classification task.
